# JCython

this repository is about my programming language I'm making in JS, HTML and CSS, this language is inspired by Python, C-based langs and other languages I've learned

# documentation

here's the documentation for this language and what it contains

## default functions

these functions are made by default and can be use (you can't yet make your own functions)

### print

if you write "print( + anything + )" it will print out everything between the brackets (you variables and it'll print anything you put there it needs to be surrounded by quotes)

## variables

you can make variables:
  - int - whole number
  - text - string in other languages
  - bool - true (1) or false (0) value
  - special - these variable type is special, they always start with $, it'll be used to change the programming language, not yet added

variables are made like this:
```cpp
int name = 10;
```

variables can be changed like this:
```cpp
name = int 10;
```

you can do basic arithmetic operations with variables like this, you can do all basic arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/):
```cpp
int name = 10 * 10;
```

with variables:
```js
int a = 10;
int b = a + 10;
print(b);
#output is 20, you can use all aritmetic operations for int in this example
```

//you can use anything from int, text or bool for now, name can be any alphanumeric values for any non 0 length, and int can have any whole number value for int
