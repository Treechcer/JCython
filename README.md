# my programming language (not named YET)

this repository is about my programming language I'm making in JS, HTML and CSS, this language is inspired by Python, C-based langs and other languages I've learnedf

# documentation

here's the documentation for this language and what it contains

## default functions

these functions are made by default and can be use (you can't yet make your own functions)

### print

if you write "print( + anything + )" it will print out everything between the brackets (you can't use variables for now, so it'll print anything you put there and for now it doesn't need to be surounded by quotes)

## variables

you can make variables:
  - int - whole number
  - text - string in other languages
  - bool - true or false value

variables are made like:
```cpp
int name = 10;
```

//you can use anything from int, text or bool for now, name can be any alphanumberical values for any non 0 length, and int can have any whole number value for int

//bool can be for now only true or false, I will add 1 and 0 for bool too (they'll behave same as true and false, but as another way to express yourself)
